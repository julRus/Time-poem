# Time-poem With Activities
This is a poem about time
A new Day,
00:00,
It's Early Morning,
6:00,
The world is waking up,
Good Morning,

Have a cup of coffee or tea,

12:00,
It's Noon, 
Luch time,
Good Afternoon,

Have a break, you've earned it,

18:00,
It's Evening,
Finished Work,
Time to rest,
Good Evening

Maybe we'll do some gardening today,

21:00,
It's Nighttime,
Time for bed,
GoodNight.

I'll be back tomorrow...
